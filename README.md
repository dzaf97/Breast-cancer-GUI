# Breast-cancer-GUI

This is a freelance project for my colleague's project name "Towards Better Breast Cancer Diagnostic using Genetic Testing and it’s Awareness among Muslim Community". 

# Description

Basically, the task that was given to me is that I need to design and make the front-end of this project by using a framework in Python3 called "PyQt5".

# Instructions

- Through website
1. Go to https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download5
2. Download the latest package under "Source Packages"

OR

- Using pip

1. pip install PyQt5
2. wheels include a copy of the required parts of the LGPL version of Qt.
3. pip will also build and install the bindings from the sdist package but Qt’s qmake tool must be on PATH.
4. The sip-install tool will also install the bindings from the sdist package but will allow you to configure many aspects of the installation.
